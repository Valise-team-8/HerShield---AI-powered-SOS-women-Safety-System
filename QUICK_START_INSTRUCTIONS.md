# 🚀 HerShield Quick Start Instructions

## 🎯 **To Fix Voice Recognition Issue:**

### **Step 1: Start the App**
```bash
python main.py
```

### **Step 2: IMPORTANT - Click the Big Button!**
**👆 Click "⚡ ACTIVATE INSTANT GUARDIAN ⚡" button**

This is the large pink button in the center of the app. Voice monitoring only starts AFTER you click this button!

### **Step 3: Test Voice Recognition**
- Say "help" clearly into your microphone
- Say "emergency" 
- Say "save me"
- Say "police"

### **Step 4: Check Status**
Look for these indicators:
- ✅ "🔊 Voice Detection: ULTRA-ACTIVE" 
- ✅ "⚡ INSTANT GUARDIAN ACTIVE - Ultra-Responsive Mode"

## 🔧 **To Fix Address Issue:**

The app shows coordinates (12.9753, 77.591) which is correct for Bengaluru.

The address lookup might be slow due to:
1. Internet connection
2. Geocoding service limits
3. Firewall blocking reverse geocoding

**This is normal and doesn't affect emergency functionality!**

## 🎤 **Voice Recognition Troubleshooting:**

### **If voice isn't working:**
1. **Check microphone permissions** - Windows might be blocking access
2. **Test microphone** - Try Windows Voice Recorder first
3. **Run voice test:**
   ```bash
   python test_voice_simple.py
   ```

### **Common Issues:**
- **"No microphone detected"** - Check Windows privacy settings
- **"Audio system not available"** - Restart the app
- **"Recognition error"** - Check internet connection (Google Speech API)
